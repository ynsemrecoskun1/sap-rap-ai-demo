## Table Type Categories

### Standard Tables
- Index access and key access
- Non-unique primary key (always)
- Suitable for sequential processing and when duplicates allowed
- Default table type

### Sorted Tables
- Index access and key access
- Unique or non-unique primary key
- Automatically sorted by key
- Binary search for key access (O(log n))

### Hashed Tables
- Key access only (no index access)
- Unique primary key required
- Hash algorithm for constant-time access (O(1))
- Best for large datasets with unique key access

" Single key field
DATA itab TYPE SORTED TABLE OF struc WITH UNIQUE KEY id.

" Composite key
DATA itab TYPE HASHED TABLE OF struc WITH UNIQUE KEY client id.

```

---

## Creating and Populating Tables

### VALUE Operator

```abap
" Simple values
DATA(itab) = VALUE string_table( ( `one` ) ( `two` ) ( `three` ) ).

" Structured entries
DATA(itab) = VALUE itab_type(
  ( id = 1 name = `First` )
  ( id = 2 name = `Second` )
  ( id = 3 name = `Third` ) ).

" BASE - append to existing
itab = VALUE #( BASE itab ( id = 4 name = `Fourth` ) ).

" LINES OF - copy from other tables
itab = VALUE #( BASE itab ( LINES OF other_itab ) ).

" FOR iterations
DATA(itab) = VALUE itab_type(
  FOR i = 1 UNTIL i > 10
  ( id = i name = |Entry { i }| ) ).

" FOR with source table
DATA(new_tab) = VALUE target_type(
  FOR wa IN source_tab
  ( id = wa-key text = wa-description ) ).

" FOR with WHERE
DATA(filtered) = VALUE itab_type(
  FOR wa IN source WHERE ( status = 'A' )
  ( wa ) ).
```

### APPEND and INSERT

```abap
" APPEND - add to end
APPEND VALUE #( id = 1 ) TO itab.
APPEND wa TO itab.
APPEND INITIAL LINE TO itab.
APPEND INITIAL LINE TO itab ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<new>).
APPEND LINES OF source_itab TO itab.
APPEND LINES OF source FROM 5 TO 10 TO itab.

" INSERT - position-specific or key-based
INSERT wa INTO itab INDEX 1.
INSERT wa INTO TABLE itab.  " Key-based for sorted/hashed
INSERT LINES OF source INTO itab INDEX 3.
INSERT LINES OF source INTO TABLE itab.
```

### CORRESPONDING Operator

```abap
" Basic mapping
target = CORRESPONDING #( source ).

" With BASE
target = CORRESPONDING #( BASE ( target ) source ).

" Field mapping
target = CORRESPONDING #( source MAPPING
  target_field = source_field
  other_field = another_field ).

" EXCEPT - exclude fields
target = CORRESPONDING #( source EXCEPT field1 field2 ).

" DEEP - handle nested structures
target = CORRESPONDING #( DEEP source ).

" DISCARDING DUPLICATES
itab = CORRESPONDING #( source DISCARDING DUPLICATES ).
```

## Reading Table Entries

### Table Expressions (Recommended)

```abap
" By index
DATA(line) = itab[ 1 ].
DATA(line) = itab[ lines( itab ) ].  " Last line

" By key
DATA(line) = itab[ id = 1 ].
DATA(line) = itab[ id = 1 name = 'Test' ].

" Using secondary key
DATA(line) = itab[ KEY by_name name = 'Test' ].

" Safe access with OPTIONAL (returns initial if not found)
DATA(line) = VALUE #( itab[ id = 999 ] OPTIONAL ).

" Safe access with DEFAULT
DATA(line) = VALUE #( itab[ id = 999 ] DEFAULT VALUE #( id = 0 ) ).

" Accessing components
DATA(name) = itab[ 1 ]-name.
DATA(count) = itab[ KEY by_id id = 1 ]-count.

" Check existence
IF line_exists( itab[ id = 1 ] ).
  ...
ENDIF.

" Get index
DATA(idx) = line_index( itab[ name = 'Test' ] ).
```

### READ TABLE Statement

```abap
" Into work area
READ TABLE itab INTO wa INDEX 1.
READ TABLE itab INTO wa WITH KEY id = 1.
READ TABLE itab INTO wa WITH TABLE KEY id = 1.

" Into field symbol (recommended for modification)
READ TABLE itab ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) INDEX 1.
READ TABLE itab ASSIGNING <fs> WITH KEY id = 1.

" Into data reference
READ TABLE itab REFERENCE INTO dref INDEX 1.

" Transporting specific fields
READ TABLE itab INTO wa TRANSPORTING name email.
READ TABLE itab TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS WITH KEY id = 1.

" Using secondary key
READ TABLE itab USING KEY by_name INTO wa WITH KEY by_name COMPONENTS name = 'Test'.

READ TABLE itab INTO wa WITH KEY name = 'Test' BINARY SEARCH.

" Check sy-subrc after READ
IF sy-subrc = 0.
  " Found at sy-tabix
ELSE.
  " Not found
ENDIF.
```

" Modify via field symbol
READ TABLE itab ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) INDEX 1.
<fs>-name = 'Updated'.
<fs>-count += 1.

" Modify in LOOP
LOOP AT itab ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<line>).
  <line>-name = to_upper( <line>-name ).
  <line>-updated = abap_true.
ENDLOOP.
```

```

---

## Group Processing

```abap
" Group by single field
LOOP AT itab INTO wa GROUP BY wa-category.
  DATA(group_key) = wa-category.

" With aggregation (group size, index)
LOOP AT itab INTO wa GROUP BY ( category = wa-category
                                 size = GROUP SIZE
                                 index = GROUP INDEX )
                      ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<grp>).
  " <grp>-size contains number of entries in group
  " <grp>-index contains group number (1, 2, 3...)
ENDLOOP.

" Without members (aggregate only)
LOOP AT itab INTO wa GROUP BY wa-category WITHOUT MEMBERS.
  " Only process unique group keys
ENDLOOP.
```

---

## Secondary Table Keys

```abap
" Declaration

  WITH EMPTY KEY
  WITH NON-UNIQUE SORTED KEY by_name COMPONENTS name
  WITH UNIQUE HASHED KEY by_id COMPONENTS id.

" Using in READ

READ TABLE itab USING KEY by_id INTO wa WITH KEY by_id COMPONENTS id = 1.

" Using in LOOP
LOOP AT itab USING KEY by_name WHERE name CS 'test'.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

" Using in DELETE
DELETE itab USING KEY by_id WHERE id = 0.

" Key specification in expressions
DATA(line) = itab[ KEY by_name name = 'Test' ].
DATA(idx) = line_index( itab[ KEY by_name name = 'Test' ] ).
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Choose appropriate table type**
   - Standard: Sequential access, small tables, need index access
   - Sorted: Frequent key access, range queries, need both index and key
   - Hashed: Large tables with unique key access only

2. **Use field symbols** instead of work areas for modification in loops

3. **Use secondary keys** for different access patterns instead of SORT

4. **Avoid dynamic WHERE** in production-critical code

5. **Use FILTER with key** for efficient filtering

6. **For large tables**, prefer hashed/sorted over standard with BINARY SEARCH

7. **DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES** requires prior sort or sorted table
